## Model_Deployment
One of the deadliest killer diseases in modern times is Sepsis. This high-risk life-threatening condition happens when the human body in an attempt to respond to an infectious disease, damages its tissues in the process. This in turn causes the organs to perform abnormally and poorly. The situation can quickly deteriorate into septic shock. There is a sudden drop in blood pressure that often leads to severe organ failures and in some cases death. There is a possibility of improvement which occurs only when there is early detection and treatment, and this will improve any survival chances of the patient. 

The main objective that I will focus on in this project will be to employ the use of several machine learning skills in model development that will be capable of identifying the presence of infant sepsis in its earliest possible time. These models will be trained as classification and regression models that will be capable of differentiating data input from control data and detect sepsis as either in its positive state or the negative state. This will be achieved through an intensive approach to Machine Learning and Deep Learning process. In the course of this project, I will apply Keras, Naive Bayes, and other statistical tools to analyze the dataset; and then build models like the extreme gradient boost XGBoost which will be used in the implementation for performance and speed of gradient boosted decision trees.
